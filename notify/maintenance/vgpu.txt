Hi,

Due to scheduled maintenance, running vGPU instances in NREC will experience
downtime on $date.

Contact: $admin

$instances

Instances running on vGPU hosts will experience downtime when the compute host
is down for maintenance. Please note that, there can be scheduled maintenance
on the second Tuesday of every month.

If you have unused vGPU instances, we would also appreciate if you delete them.
Resources are limited.

Support and contact information can be found at https://docs.nrec.no

Hi,

Due to scheduled maintenance, running instances in NREC will experience
downtime on $date. Affected instance(s) are connected to your email
$admin

$instances

Instances running on dedicated hosts will experience downtime when the compute
host is down for maintenance. Please note that, there will be scheduled
maintenance on the second Tuesday of every month.

If you have unused instances, we would also appreciate if you delete them.
Resources are limited.

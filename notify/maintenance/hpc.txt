Hi,

Due to scheduled maintenance, running HPC instances in NREC will experience
downtime on $date.

Contact: $admin

$instances

If you have unused HPC instances, we would also appreciate if you delete them.
Resources are limited.

In the future there will be the possibility of a scheduled maintenance on the
second Tuesday of every month.

Support and contact information can be found at https://docs.nrec.no

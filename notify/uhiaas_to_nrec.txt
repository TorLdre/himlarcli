On February 18, we'll be changing the name of the NREC service to NREC
(Norwegian Research and Education Cloud). There will be a small interruption in
the service on Tuesday 18 February between 14:00 and 15:00 when we will deploy
the necessary changes to our configuration. Running instances will not be
affected by this. All registered users should've received an e-mail with more
information.

Due to scheduled maintenance these instances in UH-IaaS region $region
will be rebooted on $date if they are running.

These instances have now been moved to availability zone (AZ) $region_lower-legacy-1.
This AZ will continue with the scheduled maintenance as before. New instances in
$region_lower-default-1 will not have scheduled maintenance. Please note than an
instance cannot move between AZ.

We would also appreciate if you delete unused instances.
